# Moose

Moose is a Dialogflow chatbot developed for PineTree Legal Assistance that assists users of their website with finding answers to basic questions about the services they provide, and helps them navigate to specific resources on their website. 

To re-use the chatbot, import it into the Dialogflow console and adjust the URLs within the JSON payloads to point to pages of your own legal services site. The geographic office identification features will likely have to be reworked from scratch for your purposes but are included as an example of how to approach this feature.
